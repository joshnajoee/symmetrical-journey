# symmetrical-journey
This project implements a secure user authentication system with login and registration functionality. It provides a foundation for building applications that require user accounts and protected routes. 
This authentication system is built using modern React patterns and technologies. 
Core technologies: 
React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
Vite as the build tool and development server
Tailwind CSS for styling with custom animations
Lucide React for consistent iconography

The system uses a simulated backend (localStorage) but is structured to easily integrate with real APIs. The authentication context provides a clean interface that components can use without knowing the underlying implementation details.
